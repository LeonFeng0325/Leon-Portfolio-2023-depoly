          Welcome to my personal website. My name is Leon Feng and I am
          currently an undergraduate student at University of California, Santa
          Barbara(UCSB) majoring in Computer Science, graduating at the end of
          2023.
          <br />
          <br />
          Personally, I have tremendous interests in web development and
          software system design in general. Additionally, I have over one year
          of rigorous industry internship experience in full stack software
          engineering at both startup and corporate environments. Outside work,
          I am an avid hiker, ping pong player, and occasionally cycle with my
          friends.
          <br />
          <br />
          Recently, I have finished my 12 week SWE internship at Parallel
          Systems, where I built a traffic authority management platform that is
          essential for the upcoming launching of the first fully autonomous and
          electric freight test pilot program in the U.S.
